# Team 51 2250B Final Project
The game we chose to desgin was a 2D platform game where the largest enemy in the game is yourself. The game is supposed to be similar to the game `Getting Over It` and therefore the rules are exactly the same.

# Dependencies
The game uses pytmx and pygame, use:
```
pip install pytmx
``` 

# Controls
- Hold the space button to 'charge' a jump, the longer the spacebar is held the higher the jump. 
- You are able to choose the direction of the jump with the `Left and Right Arrow Keys`.
- Move the screen of the game with `W` and `S`

# Goals And Rules
The goal of each level is to reach the top platform. The only rule is that you are only allowed to jump around to move. 

**There are no saving points in this game, if you fall from the very top you will not be able to go back to your previous position**
